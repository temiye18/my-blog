        <p>
          It all started with Flutterwave being valued at over a billion
          dollars. While we were still basking in that euphoria, more news came
          — that Kuda had raised $25 million in investor capital. Almost in
          quick succession, Kwik also raised $1.7 million in Venture Capital.
          For many African startup companies, there is no better news in the
          month of March 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, this is not the first time an African startup will be involved
          in such a big-money deal. Lest we forget that{" "}

            Paystack was acquired in 2020 by Stripe
          </a>{" "}
          in a deal worth $200 million. Similarly,{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          in November 2019. The deal was reportedly worth $200 million.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, some will say that Flutterwave, Kuda, Interswitch, and Paystack
          all offer financial services, but Kwik’s case makes this argument of
          little importance. For all the companies mentioned above, technology
          serves as their common denominator.
        </p>

        <p>
          The handwriting has been on the wall for a while, but in March 2021 it
          became visible for all to see…that the African technology industry is
          coming of age, and Africa is becoming a force that can no longer be
          overlooked in the global tech space.
        </p>

        <h4>African Tech Startup Funding Report</h4>

        <p>
          The news about Flutterwave becoming a unicorn is definitely
          outstanding, but in no way is it a stand-alone occurrence. For a while
          now, African tech startups have been witnessing a year-on-year
          increased investment interest from all over the world. What
          Flutterwave did was to wake us up to this reality — that Africa's tech
          startup companies are the new gold rush.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting in the year 2015,{" "}
          <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/">Disrupt Africa</a> has been
          documenting reports about fundings for African startup companies.
          Statistics from{" "}
          <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/funding-report/">
            Disrupt Africa's 2020 report
          </a>{" "}
          reveals that 125 startups on the continents were able to raise
          $185,785,500 in 2015. However, as of January 2021, 397 African
          startups had raised US$701,460,565 in the year 2020 alone. This shows
          a 278% increase in annual funding for African tech startups.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bulk of the funds flow into the big four countries — Nigeria,
          South Africa, Egypt and Kenya, still, significant investments have
          been reported in other countries as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          A breakdown of the sectors shows that Fintech, e-commerce, transport,
          retail-tech, e-health, logistics, energy, recruitment and HR, ed-tech,
          agri-tech, AI/IoT, prop-tech, marketing, auto-tech, and cybersecurity,
          continue to see the inflow of funds from investors.

          In truth, there are lots of problems that require attention on the
          continent. Some are so basic that they are unthinkable in other parts
          of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think about healthcare.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/taking-challenges-health-care-africa">
            A 2015 documentation by Stanford
          </a>{" "}
          shows that more than half of the continent’s population do not have
          access to basic healthcare. Also, the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/africanhealth/en/">
            World Health Organization
          </a>{" "}
          (WHO) reports that Africa confronts “the most dramatic public health
          crisis” in the world. It does not end there. More than 90% of the
          300–500 million yearly cases of malaria are in Africa.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s talk about finance. Africa still has the highest number of the
          unbanked adult population globally.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Research/GlobalFindex/PDF/N2Unbanked.pdf">
            World Bank statistics
          </a>{" "}
          put the number of unbanked adults in Africa at 350 million —
          accounting for 17% of the global total.
        </p>

        <p>
          The issue of unemployment among African youths is no longer news.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.un.org/en/africa/osaa/peace/youth.shtml">
            The UN Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA)
          </a>{" "}
          estimates that Africans under the age of 35 make up three-quarters of
          the continent’s total population. Forecast estimates that African
          youths will make up 42% of the global total by 2030.
        </p>

        <p>
          This soaring population, however, barely has any means of livelihood.{" "}
          <a href="https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/special-edition-youth-2017/africas-jobless-youth-cast-shadow-over-economic-growth">
            Further UN estimates
          </a>
          show that youths account for 60% of all of Africa’s jobless
          population.
        </p>

        <p>Africa’s problems are indeed enormous…though not insurmountable.</p>

        <h4>Africa’s Tech Industry is the Silver Lining</h4>

        <figure>
          <img

          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Despite the level of challenges, Africa’s tech industry is rapidly
          changing the face of the continent. Propelling this change in fortune
          is technology, and especially the increased access to mobile devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          The{" "}
          <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/sub-saharan-africa/">
            2020 Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa Report
          </a>{" "}
          shows that Africa has 477 million mobile subscribers in 2019. This is
          predicted to grow at a 4.3% rate until 2025. When it comes to internet
          connection, 272 million Africans are connected via mobile phones.
        </p>

        <p>
          This increased access to mobile devices provides needed room for tech
          to be a major catalyst for solving lots of problems. From fintech to
          e-health, e-commerce, ed-tech, and more, technology keeps proffering
          solutions to numerous problems on the continent.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is worth mentioning that the problems that many African startups
          are solving emerge out of necessity and organic need for solutions
          rather than disrupting the current landscape as witnessed elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h4>FinTech Solutions</h4>

        <figure>
          <img

          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Financial Technology (FinTech) has been solving the problem of the
          unbanked. In 2020 alone, ninety-nine (99) African startup companies
          raised funds from external investors (refer to Disrupt Africa
          document). This is set to continue, and the number of unbanked adults
          on the continent is set to reduce considerably in the years to come.
        </p>

        <h4>E-Health</h4>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*SUuLg2jZiVDP4o4M1eEbMA.jpeg"
            alt=""
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Africa’s e-health space is another crucial sphere that has been
          receiving lots of external venture investment in recent years. A total
          of forty-one (41) African startups received e-health funding in 2020
          alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tech innovations in health have included mobile app development,
          online drug stores, and online medical consultation platforms. For
          rural communities, USSD services and text messaging are becoming the
          go-to health integration technique.
        </p>

        <h4>Tackling Unemployment</h4>

        <figure>

          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          For the growing African youth population, technology also provides a
          way out for them to have in-demand jobs and earn a better living. The
          wide range of problems that will be solved through technology means
          that lots of opportunities will become available that African youths
          can tap into.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lots of mobile applications will be developed to cater to different
          problems (e-commerce, fintech, e-health, etc), lots of online
          marketing to be done, web designs and UI/UX Design, software testing,
          cloud data storage, business data analytics, new product designs, to
          name a few.

          part of Africa’s new gold rush.
        </p>

        <p>
          Come to think of it, many African institutes of higher learning
          severely lack the capacity to bring needed job-ready skills to
          Africa’s growing youth population. The onus, therefore, lies on you to
          make yourself relevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          UI/UX design, Software Development, Software Testing, Data Science,
          Cloud Engineering, Dev Ops, or any other tech skill you have an
          interest in. Just get on the learning train and be part of Africa’s
          tech industry.

        <p>
          As African startup companies continue to come up with innovative ways
          of deploying technological solutions to the continent’s challenges,
